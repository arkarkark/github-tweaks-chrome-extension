# Github Tweaks Chrome Extension

I'm going to put little changes I want to make to the github website here in this chrome extension.

## Issues on issues page open in a new tab

I like to keep my open issues open in a pinned tab. I want it so that when I click on an issue on that page it always opens in a new tab.
