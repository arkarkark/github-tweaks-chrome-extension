# Github Tweaks Chrome Extension

I'm going to put little changes I want to make to the github website here in this chrome extension.

## Issues on issues page open in a new tab

I like to keep my open issues open in a pinned tab. I want it so that when I click on an issue on that page it always opens in a new tab.

## Only have one tab open per issue

On github pages, links to issues will either select a tab with that issue open, or open a new tab if no tabs have that issue open.

On any other pages, you might see the new tab pop up before the existing issue tab is selected. sorry.

# Changelog

    * 0.1.1 Update page title to have issue id first.
    * 0.1.0 only one tab open per issue (even outside of github)
    * 0.0.8 only one tab open per issue from links on github pages
    * 0.0.6 open all issue links in a new tab
